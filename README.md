Hello Journal,
The terminal is a tool which allows users to create and edit code with a wide range of tools. Those tools include git, a software connected to Github which helps with web page creation and design. Vim is another tool, vim is an important skill to have for any work involving coding and data. Vim is a very old program, so a lot of useful information will have to be navigated through Vim. Markdown is a tool for creating text, I'm even using Markdown right now!
I feel confident using these tools in class, however I really stuggle practicing at home. If I could give advice to any interested student, PLEASE write down the commands you learn and what they do. The most difficult part of this course for me has been remembering commands in Vim.
