	I researched 3 real-world camera shops in the Arlington area and analyzed their websites.
[Ace Photos](https://acephoto.net/)
[Metro Camera Center](https://metrocameracenter.com/)
[District Camera](https://www.districtcamera.com/)
 Many of the websites looked very outdated, they didn't have much visual appeal. The only design theme I notices was in Metro Camera's website, where there were a few visuals of film camera reel. However, even that feels old. I wanted my website to embody the artistic spirit of photography with modern styling and a cleaner interface.

	This project was my first experience with Wordpress, and it was a big challenge for me. I felt like I had less control over what I was making as opposed to coding in html. But it was helpful for me to have templates and preset tools that I could just add to a group. Overall, Wordpress definitely frustrated me at times, however I'm glad I overcame the difficulties. I think this experience will improve my ability as a designer.
