Hello, Journal.
Today I used asymmetric encryption to send an encrypted message. Symmetric and asymmetric encryption are the two types of encryption. Each have advantages, Symmetric usually works faster, while Asymmetric is more secure and private. Symmetric encryption uses one key for encryption and decryption. Asymmetric encryption uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. To encrypt a message, start by downloading a tool or script that will encrypt your message. Then when you execute the script, you will be prompted for the recipient's github username and the message you want to encrypt. Then the encrypted message will be created and can be saved to your computer. Make sure the past few steps ran sucessfull before committing them to Git. Then, use git add, git commit, and git push to move the folder into your git repository. From there, the recipient can download the message. To decrypt a recieved message, download a decryption script and run it to access the message, then save it to the recieve folder. Then the message should appear decrypted as a txt file. One final note: never EVER share your private key. Private keys are private for a reason. If shared, keys can be stolen and used to access your data, systems, downloads, and this can be used to damage your computer in many ways.
