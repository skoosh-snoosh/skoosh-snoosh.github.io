	<h3> The Story </h3>
		<p> This recipe is a quick and simple crowd-pleaser. Melty mozzarella and savory italian sausage all wrapped up in crispy bread. Sausage bread originated in the United States as a new take on the flavors of pizza. Just like a pizza, this recipe is easily customizable and can include any number of additions. Some of my personal favorites are herb blends, red peppers, and mushrooms.

		<h3> Instructions </h3>		
		<ol>
			<li> Pan-fry the sausage in a hot skillet with a neutral oil. Fry until crisp and brown. </li>
			<li> Stretch out the pizza dough into a large rectangle. Make sure to knead well to even out the dough. </li>

			<li> Lay the sausage and one half of the cheese horizontally across the dough. Take the edge of the dough and fold it over the fillings in a rolling motion. Continue rolling until the halfway point of the dough. Lay out the rest of your mozzarella in the middle of the remaining flat dough. Continue rolling until all filling is tucked into the dough, carefully pinch the edges to close any holes in the dough that may have torn. The final product should look similar to a baguette.</li>  
			
			<li> Bake at 425 degrees until the bread is golden brown on top and is firm on the sides, about 25-30 minutes.</li>

			<li> Slice into inch-thick slices that can be eaten straight or topped with additions of your choice.</li>
			
			<li> Enjoy! </li>
