	<h3> The Story </h3>
		<p> This recipe is a quick and simple crowd-pleaser. Melty mozzarella and savory italian sausage all wrapped up in crispy bread. Sausage bread originated in the United States as a new take on the flavors of pizza. Just like a pizza, this recipe is easily customizable and can include any number of additions. Some of my personal favorites are herb blends, red peppers, and mushrooms.
